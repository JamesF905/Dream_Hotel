An online hotel room booking system for a made up Hotel, that will book rooms, make reservations for restaurant. Bookings for a spa, exercise rooms, yoga center.

AS A hotel manager
I WANT to build an online booking system that will allow guests to book rooms, and other services via the website
SO THAT I can automate our booking system

WHEN the guest visits the site
THEN they are asked when they will be staying and for how long (select a date range)
WHEN they select their date range they are asked what type of room they would like, occupants, what services they want included in their stay(pool, spa, etc)(list all prices)

THEN they are asked what services they want included in their stay(pool, spa, restaunt bookings etc)(list the prices of each service in the form)
WHEN they have completed the form  
THEN they are shown their bill with total ammount of their stay quoted, shown their check in and check out times(11am, 4pm), cancellation policy, the room becomes booked

IF they select a restaurant booking  
THEN they are given a list of restaurts on the resort to book from
WHEN they select a restaurant
THEN they given a form with date and time, type of meal, number of people, room number

WHEN they checkout 
THEN their bill is shown, with any extra fees included, the room would then become available

MVP - they can book a room, book a restaurant stay, and when they checkout the room becomes available
